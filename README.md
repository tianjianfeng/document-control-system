# Document Control System

## Domain Model

### Core Entities and Relationships
- Document
  - Has one or many revisions
  - Belongs to a project
  - Belongs to one document type

- DocumentType
  - Has many documents

- Project
  - Has many documents
  - Has many team members (through Role-Person assignments)

- Role
  - Has many team members (linking table with Person)

- TeamMember (linking table)
  - Links Person, Role, and Project
  - Has many distributions

- Person
  - Belongs to an organization
  - Works as multiple roles through team members
  - Receives document distributions through team members

- Organization
  - Has many people

- Revision
  - Belongs to a document
  - Has many distributions

- Distribution (linking table)
  - Links Revision with Team Member

## Technical Stack
- Scala TypeLevel Stack
  - [Http4s](https://http4s.org/) - HTTP Server
  - [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) - Effect System
  - [Doobie](https://tpolecat.github.io/doobie/) - Database Access
  - [Circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/) - JSON Processing

## Project Structure
This is a microservices-based project leveraging the Scala TypeLevel ecosystem.

## Microservices Architecture

### 1. Document Service
- Manages documents, document types, and revisions
- Responsibilities:
  - Document CRUD operations
  - Document type management
  - Revision tracking and versioning
  - Document metadata management
- Database: Dedicated document store

### 2. Project Service
- Manages projects and their relationships
- Responsibilities:
  - Project CRUD operations
  - Project team structure
  - Project configuration
- Database: Project metadata and relationships

### 3. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Service
- Manages organizations, people, roles, and team members
- Responsibilities:
  - User management
  - Role-based access control
  - Organization management
  - Team member assignments
- Database: User and organization data

### 4. Distribution Service
- Manages document distribution and notifications
- Responsibilities:
  - Distribution tracking
  - Notification management
  - Distribution status and acknowledgments
- Database: Distribution records

### Common Infrastructure
- API Gateway
  - Route requests to appropriate services
  - Handle authentication and authorization
  - Request/response transformation
  
- Event Bus
  - Inter-service communication
  - Event-driven updates
  - Service synchronization

- Monitoring and Logging
  - Distributed tracing
  - Centralized logging
  - Performance metrics

## Service Communication
- REST APIs for synchronous operations
- Event-driven architecture for asynchronous operations
- Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for message queue

## Deployment
- Docker containers for each service
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment


For implementation, I recommend:
Start with the Document Service as it's core to your system
Follow with IAM Service as it's needed for security
Then implement Project Service
Finally, add the Distribution Service

Each service should:
Have its own repository
Use the TypeLevel stack mentioned earlier
Have independent CI/CD pipelines
Include comprehensive testing
Implement proper logging and monitoring
Would you like me to provide more details about any specific service or aspect of the architecture?

Run the application locally with sbt run
Build a Docker image with docker build -t document-service .

Run the container with:
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://host.docker.internal:5432/document_control \
  -e DATABASE_USER=postgres \
  -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres \
  document-control


You can now:
Start everything with docker-compose up
Access metrics at http://localhost:8080/metrics
View Prometheus at http://localhost:9090
Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)


This CI/CD configuration:
Runs on push to main and pull requests
Includes multiple stages:
Test: Runs unit tests with PostgreSQL
Build: Creates and pushes Docker image
Deploy to Staging: Automatic deployment
Deploy to Production: Manual approval required
Features:
Caches SBT and Docker layers
Uses GitHub Container Registry
Includes staging and production environments
Implements security best practices
Supports monitoring stack deployment
Required Secrets:
STAGING_HOST
STAGING_USERNAME
STAGING_SSH_KEY
PROD_HOST
PROD_USERNAME
PROD_SSH_KEY
DB_USER
DB_PASSWORD
GRAFANA_PASSWORD
Would you like me to:
Add quality gates (code coverage, static analysis)
Add security scanning
Add performance testing
Add automated rollback procedures
Let me know what you'd like to focus on next!

Add database rollback procedures
Add canary deployment support
Add blue-green deployment support
Add monitoring alerts for rollbacks
